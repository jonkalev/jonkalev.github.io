 I never thought I would be a rancher, even though my grandfather was, as was his, and his father before him.  
After two plus decades of practicing architecture and planning at the age of 54 I retired and bought my family's ranch.  <p>
Maybe its in my blood as they say, I spent my year sin high school workign at the local stockayard. Monday thru friday I watered fed animals, friday was sale day when for 24 hours we sorted and loaded cattle. 
Raising cattle requires long days and weeks working in solitude. In all honesty I work harder now then when I worked a real job. Instead of a computer screen and mediatiating disputes between those developing a landscape and seeking preservation, I listen to silence  as I work fences and check cow,s watch a blue sky and thunderstroms roll in from the Gulf of Mexico in the afternoons.
  Make no mistake it is brutally hard physical work but it connects you deeply to the land, in that connection is a sublime beauty. 
      
      
  My choice to pick up a camera came after having taken a year sabbatical working as an alpine guide in the San Juan mountains of southwest Colorado. My formal training as an architect and landscaper architect did not prepare me for understading avalanche risk of a snowpack, knowing what trails went where and how to deal with bears but it was infinitely more rewarding. In the process of recovery from the "real world" I saw what can best be described as a community formed of a geology and geography as opposed to the traditional view of man imposing his will upon a landscape. Forests became less a vista or scenic experience and more a host organism. The best way I found to explore these experiences of landscapes is with my camera and drawing. 
<p>
  I'm always interested in developing compelling content, especially if its related to rural culture and their respective landscapes. Always open to ideas and dialogue. I work alone, natural light, little or no editing, minimalist approach. One camera, a fuji xpro-3 and three fixed lenses, 16, 35, and 50.
  
  I make no effort to market myself, no promos, etc. just word of mouth or if you stumble upon this site or instagram account.
